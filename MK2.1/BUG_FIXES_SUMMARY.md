# Bug Fixes Summary - Laberinto Laser

## üö® Critical Bugs Fixed

### **1. MAIN BUG: Variable Name Conflict (Automatic Life Loss)**
**Location**: `questTask()` - Line 425 (original)
**Problem**: 
```cpp
bool gameEnded = false; // Declared at function scope
// ... later in RF event check loop ...
bool gameEnded = false; // REDECLARED - creates local shadow variable!
```
**Impact**: This caused the outer `gameEnded` variable to never be updated, leading to unpredictable behavior and automatic life loss.
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate declaration, keeping only the function-scope variable.

### **2. RF2 Button Accumulation Bug**
**Location**: `questTask()` RF event processing loop
**Problem**: 
- Processing ALL queued events in one `while` loop with `break` statements
- Events would accumulate and then fire all at once when RF1 was pressed
**Impact**: RF2 presses would "stack up" and execute together
**Fix**: 
- Changed to process only ONE event per game loop iteration
- Removed the `while` loop, using single `if` check instead

### **3. Over-Aggressive Queue Flushing**
**Location**: Multiple locations throughout tasks
**Problem**: 
- `flushMainTaskQueue()` called too frequently
- Queue flushing in `rfControllerTask` removing valid messages
**Impact**: Button presses getting lost, erratic behavior
**Fix**: 
- Removed most unnecessary `flushMainTaskQueue()` calls
- Removed queue pre-filtering in `rfControllerTask`
- Increased queue size from 1 to 3 to allow buffering

### **4. Laser Check Override**
**Location**: Line 424 in original RF event check
**Problem**: 
```cpp
anyInterrupted = false; // Forcibly overriding laser check!
```
**Impact**: Could cause false life loss even when no laser was broken
**Fix**: Removed this line, preserving the actual laser state

## üîß Technical Changes Made

### **Code Changes**:
1. **Variable Scope Fix**: Removed duplicate `gameEnded` declaration
2. **Event Processing**: Changed from `while` loop to single event processing per iteration
3. **Queue Management**: Removed excessive flushing, increased queue size
4. **Laser Logic**: Preserved actual laser interruption state

### **Queue Improvements**:
- **Before**: Queue size = 1, aggressive flushing
- **After**: Queue size = 3, minimal strategic flushing
- **Result**: Better button response, no event accumulation

### **Flow Improvements**:
- **Before**: All events processed in batch, could cause cascade effects
- **After**: One event per game loop, controlled processing
- **Result**: Predictable button behavior, no "stacking" effects

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### **RF2 Button Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Each RF2 short press should immediately cost 1 life
- ‚úÖ No accumulation or delayed responses
- ‚úÖ Immediate feedback and response

### **Game Start Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ No automatic life loss when player turn starts
- ‚úÖ Laser state properly respected (disabled lasers won't trigger life loss)
- ‚úÖ Clean game state between players

### **General Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ More responsive button handling
- ‚úÖ Predictable game flow
- ‚úÖ No phantom events or button press accumulation

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Test RF2 Functionality**:
   - Press RF2 short multiple times quickly
   - Verify each press costs exactly 1 life immediately
   - Ensure no delayed or accumulated responses

2. **Test Game Start**:
   - Start several player turns in sequence
   - Verify no automatic life loss occurs
   - Test with lasers disabled (your typical use case)

3. **Test Button Responsiveness**:
   - Try various button combinations
   - Test RF1/RF2/RF3 in different sequences
   - Verify queue doesn't overflow or miss events

## üìù Notes

- Queue size increased to 3 provides small buffer without excessive memory usage
- Event processing is now deterministic (one per game loop)
- Laser checking logic preserved but no longer overridden
- Most queue flushing removed except where absolutely necessary for state transitions

These fixes should resolve both the automatic life loss issue and the RF2 button accumulation problem you were experiencing.
